Fix:

- [#49](https://github.com/fluttercandies/flutter_image_compress/issues/49): A problem of reading Exif information.

Change `reportError` with flutter stable version.

**Breaking Change:**
The autoCorrectionAngle parameter causes a number of situations to behave differently than `0.4.0`. See readme for details.

## 0.5.0

(don't use)

Because `FlutterError.reportError` method's param `context` type changed.
So this library will add the constraints of flutter SDK so that users before 1.5.9 will not use version 0.5.0 incorrectly.

using the original support library.
